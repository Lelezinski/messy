# Build the GAP SDK

In case you need to build the GAP SDK, these are the steps to follow. Change into the `gap_sdk` directory:

```bash
cd /gap_sdk
```

Then we need to run the command:

```bash
source sourceme.sh
```

and select 1 as the option.

Now we are ready to run the `make` command:

```bash
make all
```

This command will take some time to complete. Once it is done, we can move on to the next step.
